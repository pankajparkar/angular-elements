# ng-europe Angular Elements demo

This is the sample code for my ng-europe talk on Angular Elements. It showcases a working Web Component obtained from an Angular Component. Although the component is simple and the impementation sub-optimal, it uses some advanced Angular features such as Dependency Injection for a service, component lifecycle hook, parent-child component comunication and directives (ngFor and ngClass).

This repo is based on [Vincent Ogloblinsky's Angular Elements demo repo](https://github.com/vogloblinsky/angular-elements-demo) . Special thanks for making such a simplified example that works!
